For out PIC 16B project, we created a webapp to satify you dog breed needs. There are two main components to the app, a dog breed predictor, and a dog breed recommender.

Link to our [webapp!](http://pic16b-dog-detector.herokuapp.com/)

## Using the Dog Breed Predictor

Navigate to the **Predict Dog Breed** page. Upload any dog image from your computer or phone. The file type must be png, jpg, jpeg, or heic. Within seconds, the model will predict what breed the dog is. The top three breeds will be displayed.

To learn more about the model, navigate to the **Model Architecture** page to see the structure of the convolutional neural network.

After using the predictor, please go to the **Give Us Feedback** page so we can understand where our model is succeeding are where it needs improvement.
